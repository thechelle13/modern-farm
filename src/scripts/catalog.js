// Define and export a Catalog function.
// The Catalog function should accept the harvested food array as input.
// The Catalog function should iterate the array of food objects.
// As you iterate the array, the <main> element should have its inner HTML appended with an HTML representation of a food item. Use the following example for each food item. The example has Corn hard-coded. Yours should not. It should output the name property of the current food object.
// <section class="plant">Corn</section>
// Checking Your Logic
// In the main.js module, invoke the Catalog function and make sure you pass the array of food as an argument. Make sure your web server is running and refresh the browser. Your DOM should look similar to the image above.

// Please do not try to make it identical. Just make sure you are displaying them in a grid layout.
