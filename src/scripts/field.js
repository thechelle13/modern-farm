// Define a variable in this module whose initial value is an empty array. This array will store all of the plants that are growing in the field. Do not export the array.
// In the module, define and export a function named addPlant.
// The addPlant function must accept a seed object as input. The function will add the seed to the field (How do you add something to an array? Do you remember the method for it?).
// Define and export a function named usePlants that returns a copy of the array of plants.
// Be aware that when planting corn, an array of objects will be provided instead of a single object like all the other type of seeds. Investigate the Array.isArray method to check if corn got passed in, or one of the others.
// Checking Your Logic
// Write some temporary test code in the main module to check if your functions do their job correctly.

// Create a seed object.
// Invoke addPlant() and specify the seed object as the argument.
// Invoke usePlants() and store its return value in a variable.
// Use console.log() to make sure your seed object got added to the array of plants in the field.
